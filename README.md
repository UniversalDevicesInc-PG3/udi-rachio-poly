# Rachio-polyglot
This is the Rachio Node Server for the ISY Polyglot V3 interface.

MIT license. 

The Rachio water controller uses a cloud-based API that is documented here: https://rachio.readme.io/docs/getting-started.
This node server currently implements the Person, Device, and Zone leaves of the Rachio api.


# Installation Instructions:
1. Backup ISY (just in case)
2. Install from Polyglot Store
3. Enter the [Rachio API Key](https://rachio.readme.io/v1.0/docs) in the node server configuration.  See Polyglot Custom Configuration Parameters below.
4. For **LOCAL** installs (Polisy or Raspberry PI, etc...), the node server must be set up to be able to receive messages from the Rachio cloud, known as [webhooks](https://support.rachio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010542108-Public-API-documentation#:~:text=Rachio%27s%20public%20API%20has%20rate%20limiting%20in%20order,explore%20a%20non-polling%20method%2C%20we%20do%20support%20webhooks).  This requires a port to be forwarded to your node server instance so that the event can be received.  
   Select port to use for Rachio websocket traffic to internal Polyglot server (defaults to 3001).  
  * Forward selected port to internal polyglot server.  
  * Add host and port keys to polyglot configuration (See custom configuration parameters below).  Note: Use of a Dynamic DNS service for the external host is recommended.

Any Rachio units associated with the specified API key should now show up in the ISY, hit "Query" if the status fields are empty.  

## Polyglot Custom Configuration Parameters
* REQUIRED: Key:'api_key' Value: See "https://rachio.readme.io/v1.0/docs" for instructions on how to obtain Rachio API Key.
* REQUIRED: Key: 'host' Value: External address for polyglot server (External static IP or Dynamic DNS host name).  Not required or used for polyglot cloud.
* OPTIONAL: Key: 'port' Value: External port (integer) for polyglot server.  Note: This port must be opened through firewall and forwarded to the internal polyglot server.  Defaults to '3001' if no entry given but opening port is not optional (required for Rachio websockets).  ot required or used for polyglot cloud.
* OPTIONAL: Key:'nodeAdditionInterval' Value: On discovery, nodes will be added at this interval (in seconds).
 
## Version History:
* 2.0.0: Rewritten for Polyglot v2.
* 2.1.0: Updated to have each Rachio Device be a primary node
* 2.2.0: Added node addition queue with a default interval of 1 second and removed forced Driver reporting to improve performance in large installs.
* 2.2.1: Corrected "bool" definition in editor profile
* 2.3.0: Simplified driver update logic
* 2.3.1: Corrected bugs relating to setting Rain Delay and Starting Zone
* 2.3.2: Bug fix for zone start log message
* 2.3.3: Bug fixes for schedule durations and season adjustment commands
* 2.4.0: Updated to accommodate changes in Rachio Cloud API.  Added websocket support and caching to minimize API calls.  Removed drivers for "time until next schedule run" because required info was removed from Rachio API.
* 2.4.1: Corrected bug where error is generated if 'port' configuration parameter not defined.  Added closure of server.json file.
* 2.4.2: Corrected bug on setting controller active zone when watering.  Removed http server response to invalid requests.
* 3.0.0: First pass at incorporation of polyglot cloud capability
* 3.0.1: Updated reference to rachiopy project to force usage of older version
* 3.0.2: Removed init on start command per pull request due to compatability with UD Mobile App
